  <p>The project is due for 2018-07-26 before 16:00; it is counting for 30% of
final grade and is to create your site web using CSS formatting, XHTML and
HTML 5 pages, web forms pages using JavaScript (using objects Date, RegExp,
math, cookie, jQuery, etc.) <span class="boldred">(70p/100p)</span> and creating 2 documents
– user manual and technical manual (30p/100p).</p>
<p>Choose one out of 3 different domains (Sport, Traveling, and Shopping)
that you want to create your project. If you want to create for different
domain you have to mention it and send me an e-mail.</p>
<p>The web site will be formatted and using the index.html page (use framesets
  or table with divs) as of your project first page. The page should be divided
  in 3 sections.</p>
<p>The top most for presenting the logo and name of the company (Top) and also
  to be able to connect and visit to your web site (use: admin and 123).</p>
<p>Another section (Menu) will be on the left and will be used to present
  different options (internal links) to be able to visit your web site.</p>
<p>The last section (the biggest one - Content) will contain the content of your
  selection from the Menu section web pages. </p>
<p>You will show only the top login section where the user can connect by using
   <span class="boldred">Username: admin, and Password: 123</span> (global variables) and then, the
  user will access the menu links and can check all the web pages of your web site.</p>
<p>If the username/password is not correct you will show a different web page to
  create the account (show the user the password and the username). JavaScript
  (jQuery) will be used into your web site to show or hide different fields or
   web elements, login name, some calculated values, and/or the current time and
    date will be shown on some other web pages (use cookies).
The web pages will be created by using XHTML/HTML5 and CSS, and of course, will
 include JavaScript (internal or external).</p>
<p><span class="boldred">The 1st and the 2nd page </span>will describe the subject you choose: the historical
   of a region, a country, a city or a trip location, a sport team or a hobby
   like shopping; use internal links, tables, div, images and text formatting
   by using CSS (internal, external and/or inline). The description should be
   divided in multiple sections having images, headings and paragraphs. Use CSS
    formatting: margin, padding, borders, float, text alignment, colors and
    background colors, and other CSS proprieties learned during the session.</p>
<p><span class="boldred">The 3rd page </span>will show the map (of the country(s) or city and the location),
   and by using the mapping on the image, you’ll present some information (text
   and images), related to the area where the user has clicked (use internal or
    external links). </p>
  <p><span class="boldred">The 4th page </span>will present some information of your subject in details by
    using JS and form fields for the search on a particular key word subject
    (Example: user searching for: soccer or SOCCER, the Content of the page will
    display the soccer detailed page, and give the possibility to search for
    some other subject). Use JavaScript objects and jQuery in order to control
    the information to be presented. </p>
<p><span class="boldred">The 5th page</span> will contain a form and, will have at least 5 different products
   or services with the following format: ID, Name, Image, Description, Price
   and Quantity and the option to buy it or to cancel the transaction. The web
   page will calculate the subtotal, based on the quantity and the unitary
   price of different products or trips and presenting also presenting different
    options to buy those products/services. Use JS cookies to use the subtotal
    for other web pages.</p>
<p><span class="boldred">The 6th page </span>will calculate and present the amount of money the user is
  needed to buy those products or services in cash; of course the total with the
   applicable sales taxes (0.09975, 0.05). Have the possibility to pay with
   Canadian and US money (use 1.3 the average conversion factor). </p>
<p><span class="boldred">The last page </span>contains a form and will be used to show the different payment
   options with credit cards (3 different credit cards) and the billing
   information. Pass the subtotal calculated on previous page to this one by
   using cookies, add/subtract all other fees (transportation fees, discount
    coupons, etc) and present the final total to pay. If all the fields are
     validated, then display the message that the transaction is done and
     delete all the cookies.</p>
<p>
  Validate all the forms fields using Regular Expressions before "sending" the information to the server or others web pages. Add references to the existing web sites from where you are using the information to your web site. Place them on the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>You have to create 2 documents for this project. One like User Manual, where you describe all of yours web pages and the functions of your web site (see template). Another one will be the Technical Manual where you will describe the functions (code) of your web site (see template). </p>
<h3>Each document counts for 15 points for a total of 30 points out of 100.</h3>
